     TORSION OF ELLIPTIC CURVES OVER CYCLIC CUBIC FIELDS

                             by

             MAARTEN DERICKX AND FILIP NAJMAN

whose preprint can be found at https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~fnajman/cyclic_cubic.pdf

The file names correspond to the lemma's and theorems in whose proofs they are needed.
Some files do not have a lot of explanatory text since the explanation is already in 
the proof of the corresponding lemma/theorem in the article itself.
